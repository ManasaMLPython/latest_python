1. What’s the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() in SQL? When would you use each?

2. How do you remove duplicate rows in SQL while keeping the most recent record based on a date column?

3. How would you handle inconsistent date formats in a dataset in Excel or Power BI?

4. Explain the use of CALCULATE() in Power BI. How does it change the context of a measure?

5. How do you ensure data quality before delivering a report?

6. What is the difference between inner query and correlated subquery in SQL? Give an example.

7. If a column has 90% NULL values, what would you do with it?

8. How would you handle a stakeholder requesting unrealistic changes just before a deadline?

9. What are some ways to reduce the size of a Power BI .pbix file?

10. How do you manage and document logic behind calculated fields and KPIs in your reports?
1️ You have an event log with multiple rows per user.
Write a query to get the first and last event timestamp for each user, using window functions.
2️ How would you identify gaps in sequential IDs in a table — say, missing invoice numbers?
3️ Given a sales table, how would you calculate a 7-day rolling average of revenue per region?
4️ You have a products table and a sales table.
Write a query to find products that haven’t been sold in the last 90 days.
5️ How would you compare the schema of two tables (say dev vs prod) using SQL?
6️ There are duplicate rows in a table — with no primary key.
How would you deduplicate and keep the most recent record?
7️ You’ve joined three large tables. The query is running slowly.
How do you diagnose and fix it without looking at the code first?
8️ How would you pivot monthly revenue data by region (columns as months)?
9️ Write a query to find users who made exactly three purchases in the last 30 days.
10 You notice a LEFT JOIN returning fewer rows than expected.
Walk me through all the reasons why that might happen — and how you’d troubleshoot.

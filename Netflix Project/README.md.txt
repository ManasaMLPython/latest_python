# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes the Netflix Kaggle dataset using Python (Pandas) and SQL to extract insights about movies and TV shows. The analysis covers content distribution by type, ratings, genres, countries, and trends over time. The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and querying techniques to uncover meaningful patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains metadata on Netflix’s content including show IDs, types (Movie/TV Show), titles, directors, cast, countries, release years, ratings, durations, genres, descriptions, and dates added. Missing values were cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas.

## Features / Analysis
- Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows  
- Most common ratings by content type  
- Top 5 countries producing the most Netflix content  
- Genre-wise content counts  
- Analysis of key actors and directors (e.g., Salman Khan, Rajiv Chilaka)  
- Content categorization based on keywords like “kill” and “violence”  
- Identification of longest movies and TV shows with multiple seasons  
- Average yearly content release trends in India  

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- PowerPoint (for reporting)


## SQL Queries
This project includes SQL queries for:
- Counting movies and TV shows  
- Finding most common ratings  
- Listing content by release year and country  
- Genre analysis using string operations  
- Actor and director-specific queries  
- Keyword-based content categorization
